# Historic account :books:
## The symbol grounding problem 
- Closed systems of abstract symbols divorced from perception and action cannot provide an account of meaning
- Harnald (1990): "symbol merry-go-round"

# Historic account :books:
## Human exceptionalism vs embodied cognition?
##### Newell & Simon (1976): Physical Symbol System Hypothesis
<br>


> A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intellegent action

<br>

- Physical symbol system
  - Set of entities called **symbols** 
  - Expression (symbol structures) build of symbols
<br>

---
# Historic account :books:
## Human exceptionalism vs embodied cognition?
### Glenberg (1997):
> cognition is grounded in perception and action

<br>

- **Boundary issue:** 
  - what phenomena embodied cognition approaches may or may not be able to explain (e.g. abstract symbols, language comprehension)

# An introduction to embodied cognition
## Ideomotor theory 
Lotze (1852): strong links between action and perception

> Ideomotor learning occurs when people become aware that certain action consequences are caused by their movements

# An introduction to embodied cognition
## James J. Gibson (1979): Affordances 

> The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides of furnishes, either for good or ill

- An affordance exists relative to te action capabilities of a particular actor

# An introduction to embodied cognition 
## Ideas
- **notion of cognition** :thought_balloon:
   - based on interactions between mind, body and environment 
- **embodied cognition** :chocolate_bar:
   - potential of bodily functions in shaping and altering cognitive processes

# An introduction to embodied cognition 
## Mechanisms of Embodiment (Körner, 2015)

1. perception of a stimulus automatically triggers the simulation of reenactment with it
2. Simulation may be blocked by a concurrent task that involves the same sensorimotor resources
3. Simulation may also work offline
4. Simulation depends on previous experience and skills

---
#  A :mag_right: look on sensorimotor simulation 
## Relevant domains

  - language comprehension (Tucker and Ellis, 1998)
  - autobiographical memory (Dijkstra et al., 2007)
  - gestures (Alibali et al., 2014)
  - facial mimicry (Stel and Vonk, 2010)
  - problem solving (Wiemers et al., 2014)

# Conclusions :heavy_check_mark:
## Is there a coherent account?


---
# Conclusions :heavy_check_mark:
##
- Pluralistic view of cognition (Zwaan, 2014):
  - abstract and grounded symbols contribute differently to language comprehension depending on how language is embedded in the environment in which it is used
- the focus of current research should not be on supporting either embodied or disembodied accounts but on *how* sensorimotor systems and cognitive processes interact

# An introduction to embodied cognition 
## Ideas
- **embodiment** :muscle:
   - cognitive processes resulting from bodily sensations located in an "inner space"
- **embedded cognition** :deciduous_tree:
   - interactions with an "outer space"
